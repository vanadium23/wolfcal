YOU MUST USE IT.\n\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\n\n## How to Access Skills\n\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.
