# Hypothesis: Playwright for end-to-end testing with API mocking

Use Playwright for E2E browser automation testing with MSW for Google Calendar API mocking. Playwright provides cross-browser E2E testing with excellent API mocking via MSW integration, network interception, and time-travel debugging for testing time-sensitive scenarios.

## Rationale
{"anomaly": "No automated tests exist", "approach": "Playwright for E2E tests with MSW mocking Google Calendar API. Industry standard, excellent debugging tools, network interception.", "alternatives_rejected": ["Cypress (heavier, slower)", "Manual E2E testing"]}
