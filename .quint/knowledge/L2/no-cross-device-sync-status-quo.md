# Hypothesis: No Cross-Device Sync (Status Quo)

No cross-device configuration transfer. Each device is configured independently by the user. This is the current behavior - users manually enter OAuth credentials and configure preferences on each device they use.

## Rationale
{"anomaly": "User asks about cross-device configuration transfer", "approach": "Maintain status quo - each device configured independently", "alternatives_rejected": ["All transfer methods add complexity", "WolfCal is designed as a single-device app"]}
