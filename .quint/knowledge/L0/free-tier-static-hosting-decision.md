# Hypothesis: Free Tier Static Hosting Decision

Decision holon grouping multiple deployment strategies for hosting WolfCal as a static page on free tier platforms. Each alternative represents a different hosting provider and deployment approach.

## Rationale
{"anomaly": "WolfCal uses Docker+Caddy deployment; user needs free tier static hosting", "approach": "Evaluate competing free tier static hosting platforms for React SPA", "alternatives_rejected": ["Paid VPS hosting (violates free tier requirement)", "Full backend hosting (violates frontend-only architecture)"]}
