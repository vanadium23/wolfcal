WLNK: None - Current implementation is baseline. R_eff: 1.00.

Bias check: None - This is the status quo, already implemented.

Trade-offs:
+ Zero implementation cost and risk
+ Already works
+ Simple and straightforward
+ Each device completely independent
- Poor UX for multi-device users
- Users must reconfigure each device manually
- No convenience for power users
