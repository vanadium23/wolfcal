Successfully implemented React Testing Library validation tests. Verified user-centric queries (getByRole, getByText) work correctly. Tested user interactions with userEvent.click(). Verified accessibility testing via ARIA attributes (getByRole, title attribute). All tests passed (5/5). RTL integrates seamlessly with Vitest test runner, provides @testing-library/jest-dom custom matchers (toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute). Component scenario testing confirmed functional.
