**WLNK Analysis:** No dependencies → R_eff = 1.00 (self score only). Evidence from official docs (CL2: similar context) but less community activity than commercial platforms.

**Risk Factors:**
- Manual CI/CD configuration required (Woodpecker CI) - operational overhead
- Smaller community = fewer troubleshooting resources
- Less polished UI/UX compared to commercial alternatives
- Platform stability depends on open-source funding model

**Bias Check (D.5):**
- Pet Idea Risk: MEDIUM - Privacy-alignment is philosophically attractive but may not be practical requirement
- Not Invented Here: MEDIUM - Choosing niche platform over industry standards

**Operational Risk:** MEDIUM - Platform works but requires more manual configuration and has smaller support ecosystem.

**Strategic Alignment:** HIGH - Strong match with WolfCal's privacy-first, user-owned values. This is a strategic choice, not purely technical.
