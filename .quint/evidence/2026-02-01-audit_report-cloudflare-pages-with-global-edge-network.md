**WLNK Analysis:** No dependencies → R_eff = 1.00 (self score only). Evidence from official pricing/docs (CL2: similar context) + recent blog posts (2025) indicates strong platform momentum.

**Risk Factors:**
- Platform is newer than competitors (2021 launch) - less battle-tested
- Unlimited bandwidth is remarkable but pricing could change in future
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Vercel/Netlify (fewer community solutions)

**Bias Check (D.5):**
- Pet Idea Risk: LOW - Unlimited bandwidth is objectively valuable, not preferential
- Not Invented Here: LOW - Cloudflare is established infrastructure provider

**Operational Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM - Newer platform but backed by major infrastructure company. Edge network is proven technology.

**Unique Advantage:** Unlimited bandwidth eliminates scaling concerns that affect ALL other options.
